/**
 * Card segmentation and content-addressed identity, shaped by the first real portal alert.
 *
 * **The defect this closes is an identity collapse, not a parsing one.** SeLoger sends no listing
 * URL and no listing id: every link in an alert is `click.by.seloger.com/?qs=<opaque token>`, and
 * `EmailAlertSource` keys on the link with its query stripped — so all sixteen links in a real
 * message resolve to the single id `https://click.by.seloger.com/`. Sixteen cards, one identity.
 *
 * The redirect is deliberately never followed to recover the real URL: it is a third-party request
 * per listing, the token carries the subscriber's identity, and following it manufactures an
 * engagement signal from a click nobody made. Hard rule 5 one step out.
