/**
 * Logirep/Polylogis — source #4, against the payload frozen on 2026-08-22.
 *
 * The page ships all 113 records as JSON inside one script tag, so this exercises
 * `embedded_json_selector` end to end against the real thing rather than a hand-written sample. The
 * client refuses to be called for anything but the frozen page: a fixture test that can reach the
 * network is a monitoring check wearing a test's name.
 *
 * Four assertions here are not about parsing at all, and each one is a defect that would otherwise
 * be silent:
 *
 * - **`commune` must not be null.** Every text field on this Drupal/Solr payload is boxed as a
 *   one-element list. Before `Payload::scalarOf()`, all 113 commune values read as `null`, and
 *   `Criteria::matchesCommune()` refuses a null commune — so the source would have matched nothing,
 *   ever, while `SourceHealth` reported 113 items and a green status.
 * - **rent must land in `rentHc`, never `rentCc`.** The source quotes hors charges and the gap is
 *   ~30% (`1 279 € h.c.` vs `1 662,67 € c.c.` on the one dwelling measured). Filed as CC it would
 *   be compared against `max_rent_cc` and let flats through that are over budget.
 * - **a parking's room count must be 0, not null.** `null` means *unknown*, which hard rule 9 says
 *   is not below the minimum — so `min_rooms` would not reject it.
 * - **no listing may classify as an excluded tenure.** The source states no tenure anywhere, so
 *   every listing must resolve `UNKNOWN` and reach the digest, never a match.
