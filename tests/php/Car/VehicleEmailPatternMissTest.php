/**
 * F27 — THE CAR DOMAIN COUNTED NO EXTRACTION MISSES AT ALL, and the gap was built by the fix that
 * exists to prevent exactly it.
 *
 * `PatternMissLog` shipped on 2026-08-31 as Track 1h's answer to PAP running four days with both
 * positional patterns dead, 23 rows storing a null surface and 19 of them notified as MATCH while
 * `doctor` said `ok`. It landed on ONE adapter of five — `EmailAlertSource` — so `HtmlSource`,
 * `JsonSource`, `DetailHydrator` and this class counted nothing. *A fix landing on one of two
 * symmetric surfaces* is this repo's named recurring defect, and it was committed by the fix for
 * the finding that names it.
 *
 * Measured before this class existed: **13 of 99 stored ParuVendu rows carry `body`, `fuel`, `year`
 * and `mileageKm` ALL null** — the identical count on four fields being one `facts_pattern` miss
 * rather than four independent absences — with nothing counting them and nothing reporting them.
 *
 * **The first test is the load-bearing one.** The car adapter cannot funnel its four patterns
 * through one `matchParam()` the way the rent twin does — price needs `PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE` to
 * locate its line, facts needs `PREG_SET_ORDER` for named groups, title reads the SUBJECT, and
 * make/model reads whichever haystack `make_model_source` names. So there are four call sites, and
 * "four places to forget" is answered by SET MEMBERSHIP rather than by discipline: the set is read
 * from `VehicleSourceLoader::PATTERN_PARAMS` by reflection, so a pattern param added tomorrow and
 * left uninstrumented fails here rather than going quietly dark in production.
