/**
 * TRACK 6-A4 — a portal's "I don't know" token is not a make.
 *
 * ParuVendu encodes make and model in the ad path (`/voiture-occasion/<marque>/<modele>/`) and
 * writes **`/autres/autres/`** when it does not know them. That token was stored as the make, so it
 * matched no `brand_avoid` stem and the car took the whole 10-point brand share. The live row:
 *
 *     title `Ds Ds4 E-tense 225ch Performance Line` · make `autres` · model `autres` · score 15
 *
 * A **DS**, which is on the avoid list. Nothing reads as a fault — the make is non-null and looks
 * like a value, so this is not the unknown-make arm, it is a wrong answer wearing one.
 *
 * ## THE AUDIT'S PREMISE FOR THE OTHER MECHANISM IS REFUTED, AND THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE FIX
 *
 * Finding N3 offered two routes and preferred the second: *"either map the portal's `autres` token
 * to null (unknown-make arm then applies — **still full share by hard rule 9**), or read the make
 * from the title … The second actually fixes it."* The code says otherwise. `VehicleScorer`'s
 * `make === null` arm scores **0** and says `marque inconnue — hors score`, a deliberate and
 * documented deviation from the plan's own line. So both routes give this car brand 0; they differ
 * only for a make that is NOT avoided hiding behind a sentinel — never once observed.
 *
 * Building the title read for that unobserved case would be the n=1 generalisation this repo keeps
 * paying for, in exactly the fallback shape `make_model_source`'s own docblock refuses: *"a fallback
 * lets a pattern written for one haystack quietly match the other, which is how an extraction
 * failure acquires an alibi."* The title is also measurably worse than the path — over all 108
 * stored ParuVendu rows the title's first word is the make **101 times**, the seven misses starting
 * with the model (`Captur (2) Techno Tce 90`, `3 1.2 Puretech 130`) or mangled (`Il-peugeot 208`).
 *
 * ## MEASURED OVER THE STORE BEFORE SHIPPING
 *
 *     paruvendu 108 rows · `autres` 1 · every other make a real marque · 107 unchanged
 *     autohero 261 rows · leboncoin 5 rows · no sentinel token on either
 *
 * The sentinel is CONFIGURED per source, not hardcoded: it is a property of one portal's URL
 * scheme. An empty declaration is refused — a sentinel that can never match is a disabled feature
 * dressed as a configured one (the `detail_budget_per_pass: 0` precedent).
