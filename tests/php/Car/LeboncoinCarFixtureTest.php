/**
 * TRACK 2 — leboncoin's VEHICLE alert, the car domain's third source.
 *
 * Five real alerts, captured 2026-08-27 and scrubbed. Every value below was read by hand off the
 * subjects before it was asserted, which is the only thing that makes a fixture test ground truth
 * rather than a snapshot of whatever the parser happened to do.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SOURCE PROVED IS THAT ITS FACTS ARE IN THE SUBJECT. The body above the price line
 * carries the dealer's name, its star rating, its stock count and `vous présente ses bonnes
 * affaires :` — nothing about the car. The positional title reader would have titled all five with
 * that marketing sentence, and `gearboxFromTitle()` reads the title, so the two cards that state
 * `DCT-7` and `*BOITE AUTOMATIQUE` would have scored as stating no gearbox. Both are asserted.
