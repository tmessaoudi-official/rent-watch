/**
 * ParuVendu writes its facts line in THREE shapes, and for a month the pattern read only one.
 *
 * `body - fuel - Année YYYY - N km` was required, so `Essence - Année 2019 - 59 500 km` and plain
 * `Année 2020 - 80 237 km` failed the WHOLE match — year, mileage, fuel and body null together on
 * **17 of 160 stored cards (11 %)**, confirmed live by `doctor` (`facts_pattern 15/132`). Year and
 * mileage are the two heaviest inputs of the vehicle score, so those cars were judged *année
 * inconnue / kilométrage inconnu* with the facts printed on their own card.
 *
 * **THE ENVELOPE HERE IS SYNTHETIC AND THE FACTS LINES ARE NOT.** Every one is copied verbatim from
 * a stored ParuVendu description — the two committed fixtures happen to carry only the full shape,
 * and the messages that carried the short ones have long since fallen out of the IMAP window. Say
 * what a fixture is: this proves the SHIPPED pattern against real text, not a real capture. Replace
 * it with a capture the next time a short-shape alert arrives.
 *
 * The repair was trialled over every stored description before shipping, as this repo requires —
 * 143 identical, 17 gained, 0 lost, 0 changed — and the two shapes the trial rejected are asserted
 * below as the counterweight, because both were plausible and both were wrong:
 *
 *  - an optional body written `[^\n-]+?` LOSES 38 cards, since the commonest body is `4x4 - SUV`
 *    and it contains the separator;
 *  - a GREEDY optional body puts a lone `Essence` in the BODY slot — a wrong answer wearing an
 *    alibi, the `autres` class again — which is why the group is `)??`.
