/**
 * leboncoin — the first HTML-ONLY portal, against its first real alert.
 *
 * It needed a parser change rather than config alone, and the failure it would have produced is the
 * one this project is shaped around. leboncoin sends no `text/plain` alternative, so every URL lived
 * in an `href` that `strip_tags()` removed: the parser produced a perfect 15 975-character body
 * carrying all three listings and **zero links**, and a source with no links yields no listings and
 * reports a quiet market for ever. `EmailMessage::harvestHrefs()` is the fix.
 *
 * **n=1, and it is stated rather than hidden.** One message, three cards, captured 2026-08-26 — the
 * first this subscription has ever produced. The separator and `commune_pattern` are measured on
 * that single message, and this repo has twice paid for generalising from one capture (the In'li
 * lift claim, the project-wide "0 matches" claim). The second alert to arrive is the first
 * regression test.
 *
 * Everything here reads the SHIPPED `config/rent/sources.json`, so a config edit that breaks extraction
 * fails here rather than in production.
