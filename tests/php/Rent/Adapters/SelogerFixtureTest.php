/**
 * The first REAL portal alerts, parsed with the shipped `seloger` config.
 *
 * `spec/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` §11 asks for one frozen payload per source, offline, no network. These
 * two were captured from a live subscription on 2026-08-25 and scrubbed by `tools/scrub-eml.php`,
 * which refuses to write while the address, the ESP list ids or any original tracking token
 * survives.
 *
 * **The structure is deliberately NOT tidied.** The awkward `=_?:` MIME boundary, the 8bit UTF-8
 * transfer encoding, the folded headers and the RFC 2047 subject split mid-word are each a parser
 * defect this project has already had — two of them found by these very files. Rewriting the
 * messages into something well-behaved would delete the evidence and leave the fixture proving
 * only that a tidy message parses.
 *
 * Everything here reads the SHIPPED `config/rent/sources.json` block rather than an inline copy, so a
 * change to the field map fails here rather than in production.
