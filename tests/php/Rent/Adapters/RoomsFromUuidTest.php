/**
 * TRACK 1j — the generic rooms reader matched HEX inside photo-URL UUIDs.
 *
 * `ROOMS_PATTERN`'s first branch exists for French `T3` / `F4` notation. It was case-insensitive
 * and required a word boundary only AFTER the digit, so it matched any `t`/`f` followed by a digit
 * — and every alert card opens with image URLs full of hexadecimal UUIDs. `preg_match` is
 * first-match-wins and the photo sits near the TOP of the card, so the UUID beat the real
 * `N pièces` text further down.
 *
 * Fifth instance of *URLs are classified text* (corpus `url-001`/`url-002`), and the same
 * first-match-wins shape as the PAP criteria-line defect.
 *
 * MEASURED OVER THE WHOLE STORE, by comparing each row's own TITLE — independent ground truth,
 * written by the portal — against the count the pipeline stored: **21 rows wrong** (14 seloger,
 * 7 bienici), of which 12 too high and 6 already NOTIFIED with a room count the listing never
 * stated. Only `pap` configures a `rooms_pattern`; every other email source falls through to this
 * scan. The HTML sources map rooms from a structured field and are unaffected.
 *
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS DO HARM, and the low one is the one already costing matches: four real 3-pièces
 * flats were stored as 1 or 2 and silently REJECTED by `min_rooms: 3`. No false MATCH has been
 * *caused* by the high direction yet — every inflated row would have passed at its true count too —
 * and that is luck, not a guard: a `T1` studio whose card carries an `F5` UUID reads as five rooms
 * and clears `min_rooms` outright.
