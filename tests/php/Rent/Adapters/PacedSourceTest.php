/**
 * `PacedSource` is the seam that puts Q37 between the run loop and the network without teaching the
 * pipeline about time.
 *
 * The decorator shape was chosen over injecting the pacer into `Pipeline` because `Pipeline` also
 * serves `--once`, where there is no cadence at all — a timing-aware pipeline would need a "do not
 * actually pace" mode, and a safety control with an off switch is the kind that stays off.
 *
 * These tests assert what is OBSERVABLE — where the sleep lands relative to the request — rather
 * than spying on calls into `Pacer`. That is deliberate: a call-count test passes just as happily
 * when the pacer is invoked with the wrong host, or after the request instead of before it. The
 * sleeps and their ordering are the behaviour the ruling is actually about.
 *
 * Two properties matter more than the delegation, and both are about failure:
 *
 * 1. The wait happens BEFORE the request, never after. A decorator that slept afterwards would fire
 *    its first two requests back to back and only then start behaving.
 * 2. A fetch that THROWS still consumes the host's window. The packet left the machine; the host
 *    saw it. Not charging for it lets a failing source be retried inside its own window — hammering
 *    a site at the exact moment it is most likely to be rate-limiting on purpose.
