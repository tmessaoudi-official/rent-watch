/**
 * TRACK 6-A6 — the generic surface reader matched `m2` inside a base64url TRACKING TOKEN.
 *
 * SEVENTH instance of *URLs are classified text*, and the second time the same first-match-wins
 * scan has been poisoned by a URL: Track 1j fixed the rooms branch against hexadecimal photo UUIDs
 * with a left anchor, and base64url walks straight past that anchor because `-` and `_` are not
 * `[A-Za-z0-9]`.
 *
 * FOUND BY THE PLAN'S OWN A6 QUERY, on the first day it was answerable, and the plan predicted the
 * WRONG CAUSE: it expected the surface reader to need the positional repair the rooms reader got.
 * It does not. The real row, `first_seen_at 2026-09-02T05:24:51Z`, stored **7 m²** for a flat whose
 * own card says `3 pièces . 64,25 m²`, because SeLoger wraps every link as
 * `click.by.seloger.com/?qs=<opaque per-recipient token>` and one token reads `…zaw7m29jtx…`.
 * Offset 1029 beat offset 1948.
 *
 * ## MEASURED OVER THE WHOLE STORE BEFORE SHIPPING — 2 043 stored card bodies, all seven sources
 *
 *     surface   26 changed   all seloger, every one a recovery (7 → 64,25; 30 → 80,13; NULL → 65)
 *     rooms      4 changed   all seloger, the base64url twin of the Track 1j UUID defect
 *     rent       0 changed   postcode 0   commune 0
 *     inli 497 · cdc_habitat 469 · cityloger 60 · bienici 316 · leboncoin 3 · pap 62 — 0 each
 *
 * Of the 26, **seven are matches that were never notified** — they clear every numeric filter and
 * every shipped exclusion at their true size — and six more were pushed with no surface at all, so
 * the notification could not state it and the surface score component could not fire. Four are room
 * rentals the exclusions catch regardless; nine fail the ceiling or the floor at the true figure
 * too. A first draft of this paragraph said eight and five, counted with a `===` that reads stored
 * int 61 and read float 61.0 as different surfaces; Track 6-A7's report is the measured split.
 *
 * ## THE FIX IS A RULE THIS REPO HAS ALREADY RULED, NOT A NEW ONE
 *
 * `RawListing::text()` strips a URL's QUERY and FRAGMENT and KEEPS ITS PATH before the tenure
 * classifier reads it, because `?c=plai_plus` is a campaign string nobody can rewrite while a
 * `plai` PATH SEGMENT is a real social signal. The same split applies here for the same reason,
 * and this is where it was missing: the extraction readers scanned the raw body.
 *
 * **SCOPE: the GENERIC readers only.** A configured pattern owns its answer, is positional, and is
 * measured against a real payload when it is written — pap's `surface_pattern` and `rooms_pattern`
 * are unchanged bit-for-bit, which their fixtures assert. What is repaired is the first-match-wins
 * fallback that has now produced this defect three times (the PAP criteria line, the rooms UUID,
 * this).
 *
 * **AND THE LINK IS NOT TOUCHED.** For seloger the whole URL *is* the query, so stripping it at the
 * link reader would empty every notification's link and — on a portal keyed on its links — re-key
 * the entire stored backlog. That counterweight is asserted below.

     * CloudFront distribution id in Bien'ici's own photo host, `d2m2j20yzublln.cloudfront.net`. It

     * The distribution id is on every photo URL from that CDN, so this is structural rather than a

     * it changes 41 rows — but 37 of those are SeLoger tokens already closed by `9ea9d77`'s query
     * strip, which runs before any generic reader. Measuring a repair against the pre-repair
     * baseline is this repo's own *true number attached to an invented cause*; the honest figure is
     * the 4 above.
