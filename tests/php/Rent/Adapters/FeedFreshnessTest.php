/**
 * The production chain that PRODUCES a feed date, which a certification panel found entirely unpinned.
 *
 * **Three independent reviewers each mutated this path and got a fully green suite.** The master
 * switch was `EmailAlertSource::newestFeedItemAt() { return null; }` — one line, no test failure,
 * and `FEED_SILENT` dead in production for `seloger`, `bienici`, `leboncoin` and `pap`
 * simultaneously. `ImapMailbox::noteMessageDate()` had never been executed by any test at all.
 *
 * The excuse for that was *"no offline test can reach it"*, and it was false: `noteMessageDate()`
 * is pure given a raw message, the repo already reflects into this class's privates
 * ({@see \Scout\Tests\Rent\Adapters\NetworkAdaptersTest} does it for `capWithNotice` and `quote`), and a
 * fake `Mailbox` is all the source side needs. Dead safety code is not excused by being awkward.
