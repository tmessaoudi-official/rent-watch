/**
 * F30 — `advertiser_pattern` is a MESSAGE-level pattern counted once per CARD, and that is what
 * made it look broken.
 *
 * The first deployed run of the extraction-miss signal printed
 * `advertiser_pattern 375/405 carte(s) sans résultat`, and every later one prints the same shape.
 * It is not a template change: an ordinary SeLoger alert names no agency at all, and the pattern
 * anchors on the `exclusivités` template — `<ADVERTISER> vous adresse ses dernières exclusivités`,
 * one listing each — so on a full-window pass it CANNOT be satisfied on the other ~92 % of cards.
 *
 * Two failure modes, and the second is the one that matters. On a busy pass it prints a large ratio
 * for ever, which is noise. On a THIN pass — the IMAP window truncated harder, or a quiet stretch
 * where one agencyless 3-card alert is the whole pass — `misses === calls` is satisfied exactly, and
 * the WARN fires on a pattern nobody can satisfy. That fires the one signal F27 exists to give, on
 * the one occasion it means nothing.
 *
 * **DROPPING THE PATTERN WAS RULED AND THEN OVERRULED, and the reason is §1.** It feeds
 * `LandlordRegistry`, which is the whole mechanism of `dede8ac`: 23 SeLoger rows advertised by an
 * institutional landlord (16 In'li, 7 CDC) were being judged `LIBRE` at the portal's 50bp default
 * and 21 were pushed as MATCHes. Removing the key sends those back. So the question was never
 * whether to satisfy §1 but how — and the answer is the CAR DOMAIN'S OWN PRECEDENT, already ruled
 * and already tested there: a message-level pattern is not counted per card. `subject_pattern`
 * takes exactly this treatment in `VehicleEmailSource`, for exactly this reason.
 *
 * **STATED COST, and it is real:** nothing now reports the `exclusivités` template changing. The
 * ratio was the only thing watching it, and it was watching it uselessly — but "uselessly" is not
 * "not at all", and this is what the exemption buys.
