/**
 * Real Bien'ici alerts, parsed with the shipped `bienici` config.
 *
 * Three messages captured within ninety minutes of creating the alert on 2026-08-25: a five-listing
 * alert, a one-listing alert that also carries a *"Cette annonce peut également vous intéresser"*
 * suggestion, and the subscription confirmation, which carries no cards at all.
 *
 * **This is the second portal on the email-alert route and it is much the easier of the two**, for
 * one reason: it publishes a real listing id in the URL path. SeLoger sends none — sixteen cards
 * behind one opaque `click.by.seloger.com/?qs=…` redirect — which is why content-addressing had to
 * be invented for it. Here `stableId()` strips the query and what is left is the flat.
 *
 * Everything reads the SHIPPED `config/rent/sources.json` block rather than an inline copy, so a change
 * to the field map fails here rather than in production.
