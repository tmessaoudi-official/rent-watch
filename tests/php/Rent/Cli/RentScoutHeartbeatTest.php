/**
 * Q27 in the loop, rather than in the policy object.
 *
 * {@see \Scout\Tests\Core\HeartbeatTest} proves the interval arithmetic. This proves the thing
 * that arithmetic is for: that `scout run --watch` actually emits the beat, that it emits it
 * **whether or not anything matched**, and that it does not emit one per pass. Before this suite
 * existed, `RENT_HEARTBEAT_HOURS` was documented in `.env.example` and read by no code at all — the beat
 * existed only as a `NotificationKind` used by the manual `test-notify` one-shot, so a watcher that
 * died at 03:00 was indistinguishable from one watching a quiet market until somebody thought to
 * look.
 *
 * The clock is FIXED (RentScout takes `$nowIso`), which is what makes "exactly one beat" assertable
 * without waiting 24 hours: the startup beat writes a marker at time T, and every later check in the
 * same run asks `isDue(T, T)`, which is false. A second beat appearing anyway would mean the marker
 * is not being written or not being read — the two ways this feature rots into a per-pass spam.
