/**
 * TRACK 6-A1 — a failure rate that CLIMBS is invisible against a seven-day denominator.
 *
 * `WARN_FLAKY` was already here and already right about the phenomenon. What it was wrong about is
 * the TIMESCALE, and that was measured on the live watcher rather than reasoned:
 *
 *     In'li, 2026-09-01           runs  failed   rate    fires at > 30 %?
 *       last 24 h                  100      23   23.0 %   no
 *       last 7 d (the rule's)      706      58    8.2 %   nowhere near
 *
 * The daily rate went 2.0 % (08-29) → 11.3 % → 11.7 % → 22.8 % (09-01) while the seven-day
 * denominator held the reported figure at 8.2 %, and `doctor` said `ok` throughout — because the
 * interleaved successes still return ~165 items, so no other verdict can see it either. That is
 * hard rule 2's shape reached from a direction the existing rule averages away: **the window that
 * makes a sustained fault visible is the window that hides a climbing one.**
 *
 * The same class as `STALE` / `FEED_SILENT` — a correct rule whose blind spot is one axis of the
 * thing it measures — so the repair follows the same shape: a SECOND window beside the first, each
 * with its own ratio and its own minimum, and a detail line NAMING which one fired. Without the
 * name the operator cannot tell "failing hard today" from "failing steadily all week", which are
 * different faults with different responses.
 *
 * THE MINIMUM IS THE HALF THAT KEEPS IT HONEST. At ~100 passes a day a 24-hour window is dense;
 * on a cron-driven `--once` deployment it holds four runs, where a single failure is 25 % and would
 * alarm on a source doing nothing wrong. So the short rule requires a dense window and stays
 * deliberately inert on sparse deployments — the seven-day rule still covers those, which is the
 * counterweight that makes the minimum something other than a hole.
