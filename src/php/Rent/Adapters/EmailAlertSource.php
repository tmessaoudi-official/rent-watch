/**
 * Turns portal alert emails into listings. The primary path for private portals (hard rule 4).
 *
 * **THIS IS DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE, and the reason is worth stating up front.** No real portal
 * alert has been seen yet, so every extraction rule here is written against generic structures — a
 * link per listing, a rent that looks like a rent, a commune from the configured list — rather than
 * against any one portal's layout. It is built to be SHAPED by a real message, not to guess one:
 * the moment an actual alert lands in `tests/fixtures/rent/<portal>/`, its quirks become a fixture and
 * this class grows a per-portal override under `Adapters/sites/`.
 *
 * The consequence is honest and stated: **a listing this parser cannot read confidently gets no
 * tenure signal, so on a `mixed_tenure` source it DIGESTS rather than matching.** That is the
 * fail-closed direction, and it means an under-powered parser costs digest entries rather than
 * wrong notifications.
 *
 * What the class is NOT allowed to do, ever: follow the links to scrape the portal page. That is
 * the scraping route hard rule 4 gates behind an explicit flag, and doing it invisibly from the
 * email path would route around the gate entirely.

     * Where a rent lives in an alert. Ordered: the most explicit form wins.

     * Accent-folded input is NOT assumed here — this reads the raw message text, before folding,
     * because the folded surface is the classifier's and this is extraction.
     *
     * **THE SEPARATOR IS `\h`, NEVER `\s`, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS A WRONG RENT.** French rents are
     * written `1 450 €` with a narrow no-break space, so the digit class has to admit whitespace as
     * a thousands separator — and it did that with `\s`, which also matches `\n`. A line ending in
     * a digit therefore glues itself to the price below it, and `Payload::int` truncates at the
     * newline, so the rent becomes whatever sat on the previous line: `ref 850` above
     * `1 450 EUR charges comprises` extracts **850** [Verified 2026-08-25], six hundred euros below
     * reality, inside the plausibility band, clearing a ceiling the real rent does not.
     *
     * `\h` under `/u` already covers U+00A0 and U+202F, which is what the explicit escapes were
     * for. The trailing `\s*` before the currency marker stays `\h*` for the same reason — a figure
     * and a currency sign on two different lines are not one price.

     * Most specific first — the first pattern to yield a PLAUSIBLE figure wins.
     *
     * The third entry is the reason the order matters, and it was added on 2026-08-25 after a live
     * *"Baisse de prix"* alert. That template quotes three amounts: the reduction
     * (`baissé de 100 €`), the new rent (`1 100 €/mois`) and the struck-through old one
     * (`1 200 € ↘ 8%`). Only one of the three carries a PERIOD, and it is the only one that is a
     * rent — so a periodic amount without `charges comprises` outranks a bare figure, and the bare
     * figure stays last for cards that state nothing else.
     *
     * Without it the reader returned the DISCOUNT. Here that was 100 €, below the plausibility
     * floor, so the card was refused and the source reported `broken` on an unchanged template —
     * the benign direction. A 300 € reduction would have been returned as the rent: inside the
     * band, six hundred euros wrong, clearing a ceiling the flat comes nowhere near.

     *
     * **The vocabulary alone is not a reader, and on a region-mode config it reads nothing.**
     * `communeLabels` is built from the RANKED communes, which are a preference and not a filter
     * (Q1, 2026-08-22): a watch covering all of Île-de-France ranks a handful of towns and knows the
     * names of no others. Every SeLoger listing therefore came back with a commune of `null` while
     * its postcode parsed correctly — measured 2026-08-25 against the live mailbox, 9 cards, 9
     * nulls. Nothing about that looks like a fault from outside: the listing still matches on its
     * postcode, so the operator sees a notification that cannot say where the flat is, a weaker
     * `Dedup` key, and an S1 commune score that never fires.
     *
     * `commune_pattern` is the fix and it is CONFIG, per portal, because the anchor is the portal's
     * template rather than anything general about French addresses. SeLoger's is the parenthesised
     * postcode on the line BELOW the name — chosen over the *quartier* comma on the line above
     * because that line is optional: three of the nine live cards have no quartier at all.
     *
     * ORDER MATTERS, and the pattern wins. It is structural — it reads the field the portal laid
     * out — while the vocabulary is a substring scan that will happily return a ranked commune the
     * copy merely mentions (*"proche Chatou"*), which is the prototype's over-matching defect this
     * repo already documents. The scan stays as the fallback so a source with no `commune_pattern`
     * behaves exactly as it did before this existed.
