/**
 * Polls a JSON endpoint and maps it with the source's field map.
 *
 * **THIS ADAPTER IS COMPLETE. WHAT IS MISSING IS A VERIFIED URL**, and those are different things —
 * a distinction I got wrong for a while and it is worth writing down. `CLAUDE.md` hard rule 1
 * forbids writing an ENDPOINT from memory; it says nothing about the transport. So this class exists,
 * is fully tested against a fake client, and shares `ListingMapper` and `Payload` with the fixture
 * adapter — meaning a fixture test exercises the same extraction code a real poll will. Every source
 * in `config/rent/sources.json` stays `enabled: false` with a `REMPLACER` URL until a DevTools capture
 * replaces it, and the config loader refuses the combination of `enabled: true` and a placeholder.
 *
 * Three guarantees this class owes the rest of the system:
 *
 * 1. **It throws; it never returns `[]` to signal failure** (hard rule 3). A transport error, a
 *    non-2xx status, malformed JSON and an absent `items_path` are four distinct failures and all
 *    four are loud.
 * 2. **It checks `robots.txt` before fetching** (hard rule 5), and fails CLOSED when it cannot.
 * 3. **It never disguises itself.** One honest User-Agent, no cookie jar, no proxy, no cross-host
 *    redirect. When a site blocks us the answer is the email-alert route, never a better disguise.
