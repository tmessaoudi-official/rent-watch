 * The ONE place a `Source` is asked for its feed freshness.
 *
 * **It exists because there were two, and only one of them was reachable by a test.** `Pipeline`
 * and `Scout::doctor()` each wrote their own `$source instanceof FeedFreshness ? … : null`, and a
 * sabotage round showed both could be replaced with `null` while the suite stayed green. The
 * pipeline's copy is now pinned by `PipelineRunTest`; the doctor's could not be, because observing
 * it through the CLI needs an `email_alert` source whose mailbox reports a date, and the only
 * offline mailbox is {@see Mail\FileMailbox}, which reports `null` on purpose and must keep doing so.
 *
 * A test that cannot exist is not a reason to leave the code untested — it is a reason for the code
 * not to be duplicated. Collapsing the two sites into one makes the pipeline's coverage cover both,
 * which is a better outcome than two tests would have been.
