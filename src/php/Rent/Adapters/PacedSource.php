/**
 * Wraps a source so that {@see fetch()} cannot happen faster than the Q37 ruling permits.
 *
 * WHY A DECORATOR RATHER THAN PACING INSIDE `Pipeline`. `Pipeline::runOnce()` serves `--once` as
 * well as `--watch`, and a single `--once` invocation under cron has no cadence to respect. Teaching
 * the pipeline about time would therefore require a "do not actually pace" mode — and a safety
 * control with an off switch is the kind that ends up off. Here the pacing is decided once, where
 * the loop is built: `--watch` wraps its sources, `--once` does not, and `Pipeline` never learns
 * that time exists.
 *
 * WHY NOT INSIDE THE ADAPTERS. Every adapter would need its own copy of the rule, they would each
 * hold their own state, and the cross-source guarantee — *two different adapters on ONE landlord's
 * domain share a single 60 s window* — would be unimplementable, because no adapter can see what
 * another has just done. That guarantee is the whole reason Q37 is worded in hosts rather than in
 * sources, so it is the one that must not be lost.
 *
 * The pacer is shared across every wrapped source by construction: one `Pacer` instance is passed to
 * all of them. A decorator handed its own private pacer would pace nothing useful, which is why
 * `PacedSource::wrapAll()` exists and is the only intended way to build these.
