/**
 * A car portal's saved-search alert, read from a mailbox — the rent side's `EmailAlertSource`
 * rebuilt for cars, with the lessons that adapter paid for already applied:
 *
 * - **every reader is POSITIONAL**, anchored on the card's own layout (a `€` line, a facts line
 *   `<body> - <fuel> - Année <year> - <km> km`), never a body-wide scan: the alert quotes the
 *   subscriber's own criteria above the cards (`Jusqu'à 30 000 € … Jusqu'à 100 000 km`) and a
 *   first-match reader returns the search floor — PAP's defect, on the day it was built;
 * - **the subject is part of the source's scope**: one sender serves the rent alert, the car alert
 *   and marketing, so `params.from` alone admits three kinds of message;
 * - **identity is the ad link** (`/a/voiture-occasion/<make>/<model>/<id>`), the LAST matching link
 *   in a segment, which is the card's own; make and model are read off the same path;
 * - **a listing is observed when its message was sent** — `observedAt` from `sentAt()` — so a
 *   re-read older message is a superseded sighting at the store, never a price drop.
 *
 * A card whose price line is missing still yields a listing with `priceEur = null` (unknown is
 * not zero); a segment with no ad link yields nothing — it is the header or the footer.

     * {@see \Scout\Tests\Car\VehicleEmailPatternMissTest} reads `VehicleSourceLoader::PATTERN_PARAMS`
     * by REFLECTION, subtracts the unread ones and the message-level `subject_pattern`, and asserts
     * every remaining key is counted. A pattern param added and left uninstrumented fails there —
     * which is the only form of "five places to forget" that actually holds, because the guard is
     * set membership rather than someone remembering.
     *
     * `subject_pattern` is deliberately NOT counted: it decides whether a MESSAGE is ours at all, so
     * a miss means "skip this one", which is the filter working. Counting it would put every
     * unrelated mail in the denominator.
